There are multiple ways of accessing the deployed MariaDB database.

First, one can access the terminal of the MariaDB pod deployed via the
OpenShift portal. The credentials may also be retrieved from the UI
via the Administrator View -> Workloads -> Secrets.

Second, if the MariaDB client is installed locally on your workstation, use
port forwarding to connect to the database port using the username and
password retrieved from the secrets. Commands used for this method would
be similar to:

  oc get secrets {{ include "mariadb.fullname" . }}-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -D
  oc get secrets {{ include "mariadb.fullname" . }}-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -D
  oc port-forward svc/{{ include "mariadb.fullname" . }}-phpmyadmin 3306:3306

{{- if .Values.phpmyadmin.enabled -}}
Finally, since the phpMyAdmin interface was deployed, one can access the web
interface via the route presented in the OpenShift portal or via the
the HOST/PORT entry retrieved from the `oc get route` command prepended
with "https://".
{{- end -}}
